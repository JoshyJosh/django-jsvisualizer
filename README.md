JsVisualizer Django Test
========================

I wanted to try putting an existing project in a Django framework to see how it would work and to eventually push it on [heroku](https://murmuring-sands-4938.herokuapp.com/).

Heroku's version is a bit different since I had a hard time making it compatible. I ended up using [their starter template](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-django-template).

This will most likely stop with this commit since it was more an experiment than anything else. Feel free to give suggestions for improvements.
